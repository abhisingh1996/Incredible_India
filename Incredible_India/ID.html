<p><h2>Independence Day, observed annually on 15 August, is a National Holiday in India commemorating the nation's independence<br> from the British Empire on 15 August 1947. India attained independence following an Independence Movement noted for <br> largely nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience led by the Indian National Congress (INC). Independence coincided with<br> the partition of India, in which the British Indian Empire was divided along religious lines into the Dominions of India and <br>Pakistan; the partition was accompanied by violent riots and mass casualties, and the displacement of nearly 15 million people <br>
due to sectarian violence. On 15 August 1947, Jawaharlal Nehru, who had become the first Prime Minister of India that day,<br> raised the Indian national flag above the Lahori Gate of the Red Fort in Delhi. On each subsequent Independence Day,   the <br>prime minister has raised the flag and given a speech.</h2></p>
<p><u><b><h2>HISTORY</h2></b></u></p>
<p><h2>European traders had established outposts on the Indian subcontinent by the 17th century. Through overwhelming military <br>strength, the British East India company subdued local kingdoms and established themselves as the dominant force by the <br>18th century. Following the Rebellion of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led the British Crown to assume direct <br>control of India. In the decades following, civic society gradually emerged across India, most notably the Indian National <br>Congress Party, formed in 1885. The period after World War I was marked by British reforms such as the Montagu–Che-<br>lmsford Reforms, but it also witnessed the enactment of the repressive Rowlatt Act and calls for self-rule by Indian<br> activists. The discontent of this period crystallized into nationwide non-violent movements of non-cooperation and civil diso-<br>bedience, led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.[5]:167

During the 1930s, reform was gradually legislated by the British; Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[5]:195–197 The next decade was beset with political turmoil: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress' final push for non-cooperation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism led by the All-India Muslim League. The escalating political tension was capped by Independence in 1947. The jubilation was tempered by the bloody partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan.During the 1930s, reform was gradually legislated by the British; Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[5]:195–197 The next decade was beset with political turmoil: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress' final push for non-cooperation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism led by the All-India Muslim League. The escalating political tension was capped by Independence in 1947. The jubilation was tempered by the bloody partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan.[5]:203At the 1929 Lahore session of the Indian National Congress, the Purna Swaraj declaration, or "Declaration of the Independence of India" was promulgated,[6] and 26 January was declared as Independence Day.[6] The Congress called on people to pledge themselves to civil disobedience and "to carry out the Congress instructions issued from time to time" until India attained complete independence.[7] Celebration of such an Independence Day was envisioned to stoke nationalistic fervour among Indian citizens, and to force the British government to consider granting independence.[8]:19

The Congress observed 26 January as the Independence Day between 1930 and 1956.[9][10] The celebration was marked by meetings where the attendants took the "pledge of independence".[8]:19–20 Jawaharlal Nehru described in his autobiography that such meetings were peaceful, solemn, and "without any speeches or exhortation".[11] Gandhi envisaged that besides the meetings, the day would be spent "... in doing some constructive work, whether it is spinning, or service of 'untouchables,' or reunion of Hindus and Mussalmans, or prohibition work, or even all these together".[12] Following actual independence in 1932, the Constitution of India came into effect on and from 26 January 1950; since then 26 January is celebrated as Republic Day.
