<p>Situated at a height of 4,250 meters, far away in barren land in Ladakh, Pangong Tso is one of the largest brackish lakes in Asia.
The crystal clear blue lake sprawls over an area of 100 kilometers across the borders of two countries in India and China. It is one 
of the charismatic lakes situated on the Changtang plateau in eastern Ladakh region. Pangong Lake is also known by the name of
Hollow Lake and appears as a clear symbol of nature craftsmanship. The brackish water plays with sunlight to produce different
effects of light. One-third part of the lake lies in India while the remaining two-third lies in Tibet, a region controlled by China. A 
large chunk of streams that fill the lake are located on the Tibetan part. The lake is located just 5 hours drive from Leh in the Ladakh 
region of Jammu & Kashmir. The first glimpse of the tranquil, azure blue waters and shaky lakeshore remains etched in the memory 
of tourists. This area falls under army control and requires pass from deputy commissioner of Leh. During the winter season, the lake and its surroundings are engulfed by freezing temperature. The surface of the lake becomes so solid that one canâ€™t walk over it. On the surface of frozen lake a gala festival of ice skating is organized. It calls on large number of skiers and ice skaters from several parts of the world. During this festival, tourists also get to see the local culture of the native people. The route passes through beautiful Ladakh countryside, over Chang La, the third highest motorable mountain pass in the world. Traces of snow along the road welcome us. One can cross the valley on sinking road. The mountains in the backdrop appeared to be painted in the colors of green, brown and violet. There is a mountaineering school, which imparts training in various degrees of rock climbing.</p>
